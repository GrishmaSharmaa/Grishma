    <h2>2. It Starts with Us</h2>
<p>“It Starts With Us” is Colleen Hoover’s sequel to her best-selling novel and BookTok sensation, “It Ends With Us.” <br> <br>
 
  The sequel begins directly after “It Ends With Us” and brings the reader through the intricacies of life after divorce and domestic abuse. “It Starts With Us” is a lighter read than its predecessor,  allowing the reader to experience Atlas and Lily’s relationship as they navigate divorce, found family and starting a new life after abuse. In many ways, Hoover presents a “second-chance” romance that alternates between Atlas’s and Lily’s points of views. <br> <br>
 
  “It Ends With Us” must be read first in order to fully understand the magnitude of some of the trivial events in “It Starts With Us.”</p>
